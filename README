INTRO TO NLP (Assignment-4-Task-1)

Please place the file assig_4_task_1.py in the directory which contains the directory named 
"a4_data". The directory named "a4_data" is the directory which contains all the json 
files(relations).

Create a directory named "task1" in the same directory where "a4_data" is placed. 

Make a subdirectory named "runs" inside the "task1" directory.

Run the program. It will generate award.txt, business.txt, film.txt, music.txt, people.txt
and relation_filtered_sentences.txt inside the runs directory. The first five are the outputs 
of task1, while the last one is generated to report our findings for the taks.
